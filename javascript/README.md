# JavaScript Code Style

JavaScript can be your best friend or your worst enemy, the choice is yours. But we believe that JavaScript is our best friend because we treat it respect, invite it to dinner, and even watch it's dog from time to time. We tend to adhere to strict style and lint our code but keep that between us.

## Style

Instead of re-inventing the wheel, we piggy back on the hard work over at AirBnB and use their style guide. It falls in line with what we would have produced anyway with the exception of one thing: double quotes `""` instead of single quotes `''`. Why? Because fuck you, that's why.

## Linting

Linting your code is not only recommended, it should be a requirement. There really isn't a good reason to not lint, but if you think of one please submit a pull request and I'll be sure to mark it closed without actually reading it.

We rely on the npm module [eslint](http://eslint.org/) to do the processing. At Jump, this is bundled automatically into our projects using our [project-baseplate](https://github.com/JUMP-Agency/project-baseplate).
